                <p class="gamestop-red">To Our Valued Guests,</p>
                <p class="gamestop-red">On behalf of the entire GameStop team, we would like to say thank you again for your loyalty and support. When the COVID-19 pandemic first began, none of us could have predicted how long it would last, or how dramatically it would alter our lives.</p>
                <p class="gamestop-red">During this time, we’ve worked diligently to adapt our business so that we can continue to be there for you, our associates, and communities. We’ve learned and implemented new operational practices in order to safely deliver the gaming and entertainment products that you enjoy. Throughout it all, our associates have remained steadfast to serve you and each other. I am very proud of the resilience they’ve demonstrated during this time.</p>
                <p class="gamestop-red">Now that local mandates allow us to open GameStop stores in your area, we want to share with you our own demanding criteria for reopening them in the safest manner possible. The health and well-being of each of you and each of our employees are our greatest areas of focus. Until a store meets the criteria below, we will not reopen it until we are satisfied that it is safe to do so. Notably, we have implemented additional safety measures that go beyond your state’s safety requirements to reopen. These standards include:</p>
