<h3>Animal Crossing New Horizons</h3>
<p> This is Animal Crossing’s 5th title in the main series, which was released on March 20th, 2020. This is also a game that was delayed from its original release date of sometime in 2019. The cute family game is one of the games that has released during this pandemic and has had nothing but success. As of right now, it has the highest Metacritic score with a 91 throughout the entire series. New Horizons sold 1.88 million physical copies at launch in Japan, which is now number one in history, beating Pokemon Sword and Shield for the biggest Switch game in the region. If you ever wanted to get away to a deserted island with animals (I wish for this all the time), then this is the game for you. Take your customizable character and make the best animal getaway possible.</p>

<h3>The Last of Us Part II</h3>
<p>The Last of Us Part II is a sequel I didn't expect given how perfectly the first chapter concludes, or even want since it means Ellie and Joel will be thrown into harm's way again. As stressful as this forthcoming journey will likely be, any
game that comes out of Naughty Dog becomes a generation-defining event, and I expect nothing less from Last of Us Part II. We just have to hope for the best for Ellie and Joel, but it's safe to assume Naughty Dog is going to throw them to
the wolves in another emotional, violent, and unpredictable story. The chaos begins on May 29 for PlayStation 4.</p>

<h3>Final Fantasy VII Remake</h3>
<p>Square Enix's decision to turn Final Fantasy VII Remake into an episodic series is concerning, especially given how long it's taken to get to this point, but knowing we'll spend more quality time with Cloud and Tifa isn't a bad thing, right?
Square hasn't been shy about showing fans what can expect from this return. The redesigned combat system looks fun and deep, and Midgar looks like a fully-realized place we'll get to explore fully. We'll find out if this classic was worth
returning to in just a few months when it hits stores on March 3, 2020.</p>

<h3>Resident Evil 3</h3>
<p>Released on April 3rd, 2020, the classic PlayStation 1 remake is definitely a game to keep your eye on. Play as Jill Valentine once again and fight zombies and the formidable Nemesis. Compared to Resident Evil 2’s remake of Mr. X, Nemesis may be a more difficult foe to fight. Even though the story for the third remake is less than 10 hours long to complete, it comes with another game called Resident Evil Resistance to fill your time. This is a multiplayer mode where four players try to survive while the fifth player is setting up traps, dangerous enemies, and more to prevent them from reaching their goal.</p>
